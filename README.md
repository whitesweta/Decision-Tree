# Decision-Tree Aritificial Intelligence Algorithm

Program takes two file names as command line arguments, construct a classifier from the training
data in the first file, and then evaluate the classifier on the test data in the second file.

Can be run with the hepatitis-training.dat and hepatitis-test.dat files - reports the classification accuracy 
in terms of the fraction of the test instances that it classified correctly. Report the learned decision tree classifier. 

helper-code.java - contains java code that may be useful for reading instance data from the data files. Was supplied
